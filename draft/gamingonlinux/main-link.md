## Technical Support Links

Generally, the first port of call for problems that you may encounter is the dedicated support (forums, IRC, knowledgebases etc) provided by the Linux distribution that you're using. The relevant distro subreddit may also be useful. If the problem is a game-specific one, then searching out support from the game's site or Steam community hub may be of help. Otherwise, you may find the following links of use:
