## [General]{#General .mw-headline}[[\[]{.mw-editsection-bracket}[edit](/w/index.php?title=Linux&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: General")[\]]{.mw-editsection-bracket}]{.mw-editsection}

-   The strength and weakness of Linux is its freedom of user choice.
-   There are no best distros; it all depends on the user\'s need. It is
    common to switch between distros (\"distro hopping\") until settling
    on one.
-   Always refer to the documentation of the chosen distro in case there
    is a problem. It\'s advisable to check the
    [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/){.external .text} regardless
    of the distro as it is broadly and succinctly written. In addition,
    reaching out to the distro\'s community for support is always an
    option.
-   Use virtual machines to test distros.
    -   Some Linux distributions (all major ones, but not every single
        one) are supported by a tool called
        [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/plugin_vtoyboot.html){.external
        .text}, which allows you to install the distro into a virtual
        machine virtual disk file, and then boot it on your physical
        hardware. This allows you to try out distributions and even
        games on your real physical hardware without having to commit to
        removing your existing operating system or dual booting.

## [Distributions]{#Distributions .mw-headline}[[\[]{.mw-editsection-bracket}[edit](/w/index.php?title=Linux&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Distributions")[\]]{.mw-editsection-bracket}]{.mw-editsection}

There are two types of release models for Linux distros.

### [Fixed release]{#Fixed_release .mw-headline}[[\[]{.mw-editsection-bracket}[edit](/w/index.php?title=Linux&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Fixed release")[\]]{.mw-editsection-bracket}]{.mw-editsection}

::: {.svg-icon .svg-16 .thumbs-up title="Advantage"}
:::

Offers stable packages.

::: {.svg-icon .svg-16 .thumbs-up title="Advantage"}
:::

Most distros are beginner-friendly.

::: {.svg-icon .svg-16 .thumbs-up title="Advantage"}
:::

Very little maintenance.

::: {.svg-icon .svg-16 .thumbs-down title="Disadvantage"}
:::

Package versions are usually tied to distro version, so the OS needs to
be updated to get the latest packages.

::: {.svg-icon .svg-16 .thumbs-down title="Disadvantage"}
:::

Stable packages typically don\'t have the newest features. This is
especially important in the case of
[GPU](/wiki/Glossary:Graphics_card "Glossary:Graphics card") drivers.\
This issue is alleviated by the fact that the vast majority of
user-facing applications are now available as a
[Flatpak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatpak "w:Flatpak"){.extiw},
[Snap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(software) "w:Snap (software)"){.extiw}
or and
[AppImage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppImage "w:AppImage"){.extiw}
which allow you to run the latest version of the application regardless
of what exact version of underlying OS you have.

::: {.svg-icon .svg-16 .thumbs-down title="Disadvantage"}
:::

Manual intervention is required to add user-made repositories in some
distros.

::: {.svg-icon .svg-16 .info-icon title="Information"}
:::

Updating a distro to the latest version doesn\'t normally require a
fresh install, but can take up to several hours.

::: {.svg-icon .svg-16 .info-icon title="Information"}
:::

Many Debian-based distros offer
[\"backports\"](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports){.external
.text} and/or
[\"testing\"](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting){.external .text}
modes that provide newer versions of some packages than what the stable
version does.

::: {.svg-icon .svg-16 .thumbs-up title="Advantage"}
:::

Provides the latest version of packages once as soon as they\'re
released by the upstream developers.

::: {.svg-icon .svg-16 .thumbs-up title="Advantage"}
:::

No distro upgrade procedure is required, as most distros have only one
version.

::: {.svg-icon .svg-16 .thumbs-down title="Disadvantage"}
:::

A package update may cause stability issues, as extensive testing is
usually limited.

::: {.svg-icon .svg-16 .thumbs-down title="Disadvantage"}
:::

No currently-listed rolling release distribution has official support
from any digital distribution store, due to the distros\' reliance on
`.rpm` binaries instead of `.deb`.

::: {.svg-icon .svg-16 .info-icon title="Information"}
:::

Some distros offer a semi-rolling release, meaning that packages will be
tested before releases.

By default, Linux is a text/command-line based operating system.
However, the Linux community has created varieties of desktop
environments to offer a user-friendly GUI experience. Most include their
own basic software for common use cases, such as a file explorer or word
processor.

As a rule of thumb, environments with heavy RAM use typically add
another 500 MB to the operating system\'s RAM requirements (which
usually range from 500Â MB to 4 GB), compared to environments with light
RAM use.

It is important to update the Linux kernel as new versions provide
security updates, bugfixes, better performance, and support for
hardware. A distro\'s repository contains all the supported versions for
that distro.

There are two main releases of the official Linux kernel:

-   Long Term Support (LTS) is slightly behind in terms of hardware
    support and features, but offers better stability and has longer
    support.
-   Stable release (sometimes called the current release) offers the
    best hardware support and the newest features. It should be the
    default choice for a gaming machine and be avoided only if it causes
    issues.

Despite these differences, both releases offer the same security
updates.

**This section is meant for advanced users, you can easily break your
OS, if you don\'t know what you are doing!**

While both stable and LTS Linux kernel releases can be used for gaming,
there are also community-made ones which add features and improvements.
These kernels may or may not improve one\'s gaming experience, and may
require DKMS (dynamic kernel module support) versions of drivers and
headers to make hardware usable with multiple kernels.

The most notable releases:

It is vital to install the microcode for the CPU as the manufacturer
provides security and stability updates, although most often your
distribution will push those updates directly to you. Most distributions
use either package manager or some kind of firmware/drivers manager to
update the microcode.

Generally speaking, if you use AMD graphics, you\'re likely to have a
flawless experience as AMD makes open source drivers available and Linux
developers integrate them directly into the kernel.

::: {.svg-icon .svg-16 .thumbs-down title="Disadvantage"}
:::

Generally speaking, if you use Nvidia graphics, you\'re likely to have
to make some independent efforts to either install or enable Nvidia
drivers, as Nvidia does not offer any open-source drivers which makes
the distribution maintainers hesitant when it comes to packaging or
enabling Nvidia drivers by default.\
Nvidia\'s drivers are also of worse quality than either AMD\'s own Linux
drivers or Nvidia\'s Windows driver, with features that exist in the
Windows drivers missing in the same card\'s Linux driver. This is
entirely Nvidia\'s choice, and Linux developers and maintainers can do
almost nothing to rectify the consequences of Nvidia\'s behaviour.

Generally, AMD/ATI users should use [the open source
driver](/wiki/Mesa "Mesa") as it provides the best performance and
support compared to the proprietary ones, while Nvidia users should
stick to the proprietary ones. There are some things to remember:

-   **Try not to install drivers from the GPU manufacturer\'s website
    unless forced to**, as distro maintainers package the driver to be
    offered from the package manager.
-   If forced to use Catalyst, Nvidia 173, or Nvidia 96 drivers, one
    must downgrade Xorg to the last supported version.
-   Before using the open source driver **one must install LLVM and
    Linux Firmware packages**.

**Fedora**

To install Nvidia drivers on Fedora, it is usually sufficient to install
the latest Nvidia drivers from the software center. Simply search for
Nvidia and install the driver with the highest version number.

If you have a more complex setup, such as an Optimus laptop, or the
above instructions do not work for you, you can also user \'[NVIDIA Auto
Installer for Fedora
Linux](https://github.com/t0xic0der/nvidia-auto-installer-for-fedora-linux){.external
.text}\'. It is a set of scripts which can handle both normal installs
and more advanced configurations.

To use it, execute the following in the terminal:

` sudo dnf install dnf-plugins-core -y && sudo dnf copr enable t0xic0der/nvidia-auto-installer-for-fedora -y && sudo dnf install nvautoinstall -y`

Once installed, type in `nvautoinstall` into your terminal. The program
will show you the options you can use.

The most basic installation is performed by issuing the following
command:

`sudo nvautoinstall rpmadd && sudo nvautoinstall drive`.

To install support for Vulkan API (will be functional only if you have a
Vulkan capable GPU and driver), execute the following command
`sudo dnf install vulkan-loader vulkan-loader.i686`

Optimus support in Nvidia GPUs is still considered to be troublesome.

In case of laptops which has Nvidia Optimus support, it is recommended
to have PRIME enabled, which can be done by installing an additional
package. Follow the distro's documentation to set this up.

AMD users only require running the game with the `DRI_PRIME=1` command.

While the file system used on Windows, NTFS, is supported, it is
generally not recommended to use as it may cause compatibility issues.

The most important aspect of the disk partitioning is often the swap
partition; it generally acts as RAM replacement. The absence of it will
cause software to shut down due to low memory, and it is also used to
offload memory from RAM when entering power saving modes such as
Hibernation or Sleep. The size of the swap disk depends on how much RAM
is available in the computer; if less than 8 GB of RAM, increase the
swap disk, or if more than 8 GB of RAM, decrease the swap disk.

It is generally recommended to partition disks in this particular order:

1.  / (Root)
2.  Home
3.  Swap disk

A user can create multiple partitions for each directory with a specific
disk size to use or use the entire free space on Root and leave some for
swap.

are [Wayland](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wayland){.external .text}
and [Xorg](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xorg){.external .text}.

While Wayland offers more a modern and secure backend, Xorg has legacy
support and will generally be more compatible than Wayland. In addition,
Wayland is still in active development and is missing features that
would provide a gaming experience in parity with Xorg.

Benchmarking in Linux can be achieved with the [Phoronix Test
Suite](https://www.phoronix-test-suite.com){.external .text}. It is easy
to use despite not offering a user-friendly GUI. The biggest advantage
is it saves the information as a webpage, making comparing tests much
easier.

Steam users can use Valve\'s
[voglpref](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/voglperf){.external .text},
which requires Steam.

Since Linux 3.9 and recent QEmu version, it is possible to passthrough a
graphics card, motherboard, or even other hardware into a virtual
machine. The main advantage of it is having a native GPU working on
Windows in a virtual machine, which allows you to play Windows games on
it while using Linux.

There are some disadvantages:

-   A second GPU for PCI passthrough is required
-   GPU must support UEFI
-   CPU must support hardware virtualization and IOMMU
-   Motherboard must support IOMMU
-   It is not an easy process for beginners

Wine (Wine Is Not an Emulator) is a compatibility layer which allows
users to run Windows programs in Linux. Its main advantage is a wide
support of Windows versions ranging from 3.11 to Windows 10, both 32-bit
and 64-bit architectures. There are multiple versions of Wine each with
their own differences:

-   Normal
-   Staging - Provides additional features such as CSMT which may or may
    not improve the performance of the game and contains community-made
    patches which improves the compatibility.
-   [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton){.external .text} -
    A fork of Wine created by Valve and CodeWeavers which includes
    special patches and additional addons such as DXVK, FAudio, and
    ESync. It is intended for gaming and does not require Steam to use.
-   [Proton-GE](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom){.external
    .text} - A fork of Proton by GloriousEggroll which has FFmpeg
    enabled for FAudio by default, and all of Proton\'s patches ported
    over to be applied to WINE, as well as Wine-Staging and VKD3D.
    Proton-GE will generally work better with games, and some specific
    games only work on GE. The ProtonDB will contain pertinent
    information.
-   [tkg](https://github.com/Frogging-Family/wine-tkg-git){.external
    .text} - Considered to be a \"Wine to rule them all!\" it contains a
    large set of patches and features from other community projects to
    provide the best performance and compatibility for games. It can be
    easily customized. It was mainly made for Arch Linux and its
    derivatives, but it is possible to use it in other distributions.
-   Gallium Nine - Uses Gallium3D State Tracker, which dramatically
    improves the performance for games using DirectX 9, as it won't
    translate Direct3D calls into OpenGL. So far only AMD, Nvidia
    graphics cards which rely on open source drivers and Intel graphics
    using Iris or Crocus driver have a support for Gallium 3D Nine which
    greatly benefits the compatibility and performance with DirectX
    9-based games.

There are many frontends to Wine, which improves the experience with
using it:

**Disable mitigations for transient execution CPU vulnerabilities**

::: {.svg-icon .svg-16 .thumbs-down title="Disadvantage"}
:::

Be aware that disabling these will cause your PC to be susceptible to
multiple vulnerabilities such as Spectre, Meltdown, ZombieLoad etc. Use
it with discretion.

::: {.svg-icon .svg-16 .info-icon title="Information"}
:::

Outside of specific microbenchmarks, disabling the default mitigations
should result into an average performance increase of 5-10%. The
following parameter used in here is available only in 5.1.13 kernel or
newer [(or backports to 3.16.68, 4.4.180, 4.9.176, 4.14.119 and
4.19.43)]{.small}, for others see [this parameters

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| In some desktop environments such as LXQt, the system shutdown or     |
| restart process may take longer due to Systemd having the time to     |
| stop the session set to 1 minute 30 seconds by default.               |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  Edit as a root the system.conf file located in `/etc/systemd/`    |
| 2.  Find **DefaultTimeoutStartSec** and **DefaultTimeoutStopSec**,    |
|     uncomment them if necessary and set the time limit in seconds.    |

**Resolution scaling with xrandr**

It is entirely possible to scale the resolution through multiplications
(`--scale`) or by resolution (`--scale-from`) with `xrandr` command.
Provided that you input the monitor name and your current resolution,
which can be learned by using `xrandr -q` command (It will also list
available resolutions).

Here are some examples:

-   `xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1024x768 --scale 0.5x0.5` - this will
    downscale the resolution by 0.5 while using 1024x768 resolution in
    VGA1 monitor.
-   `xrandr --output VGA3 --mode 1920x1080 --scale-from 1440x900` - This
    command will imitate the 1440x900 resolution under 1080p in your
    VGA3 monitor.

**Use Feral Game Mode to improve the performance**

::: {.svg-icon .svg-16 .info-icon title="Information"}
:::

Most distros includes the software in their repository, it is
recommended to install both 64 and 32 bit versions to apply in every
game, if not, the source code can be found in the [GitHub
page](https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode){.external .text}.

::: {.svg-icon .svg-16 .thumbs-up title="Advantage"}
:::

Supports custom scripts

::: {.svg-icon .svg-16 .thumbs-up title="Advantage"}
:::

Developers can use it to implement in their games.

Feral Game Mode is used by Feral Interactive to provide optimization in
their games (From Rise Of The Tomb Raider) when being ran, it provides
changes to these following processes:

-   CPU governor
-   Input/Output priority
-   Process niceness
-   Kernel scheduler
-   Screensaver inhibiting
-   GPU performance mode (Nvidia and AMD), GPU overclocking (Nvidia)

Once the package is installed, you can activate it when running other
games with `gamemoderun *game executable/launcher*`, on Steam add
`gamemoderunÂ %command%` into Launch Options.

**Enable 32-bit support for your distro**

| Enable 32-bit library support in Ubuntu/Debian based distros          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| As Ubuntu/Debian 64-bit distros have 32-bit libraries disabled by     |
| default, this can cause compatibility issues with the software        |
| (Especially with upgrading Wine). To enable it you must use these     |
| following commands:                                                   |
|                                                                       |

**List missing dependencies**

| List the missing dependencies                                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| As GOG, Steam and other stores mostly support Ubuntu due to its       |
| popularity in both making another distribution (Such as Linux Mint)   |
| or wide use, there can be a limited support for the other distros     |
| such as Arch Linux, Fedora, etc. Mostly in terms of requiring         |
| dependencies to run the game or a software.                           |
|                                                                       |
| The `ldd` command can be used to check which dependency does it       |
| require and if they are in your system.                               |
|                                                                       |
|     ldd <binary file>                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| After running the command, it\'ll list all the \*.so files the        |
| software uses, if there is a \"Not found\" somewhere, this is the     |
| moment to learn which package does it contain the file.               |
|                                                                       |
| The missing dependency checkup can be even easier with the inclusion  |
| of the `grep` command.                                                |
|                                                                       |
|     ldd <binary_file> | grep "Not found"                              |
|                                                                       |
| This will only look for the lines related to \"Not found\" only, if   |
| nothing shows up then you have everything you need.                   |

| You may also use GNOME, Cinnamon and KDE Plasma which use their own   |
| compositor that directly communicates with the GPU without any        |
| performance loss from Nvidia side.                                    |
|                                                                       |
| Nvidia users can fix the screen tearing by enabling **Force           |
| Composition Pipeline** in Nvidia Settings, if it persists, enable     |
| **Force Full Composition** (Keep in mind that it reduces the          |
| performance in games even more).                                      |
|                                                                       |
| AMD and Intel HD users do not have to do anything as DRI3 handles the |
| refresh rate by default without compromising the performance,         |
| provided the compositor contains the Present extension.               |
|                                                                       |
| If it persists, chances are you may be required to install and use a  |
| 3rd party compositor such as Compiz, Compton etc.                     |
