 
If you use Proton, this program is called "Protontricks", but it's still the same program.

Winetricks is a program that lets you do tweaks that would otherwise be much harder to do.

== Opening Winetricks ==

=== Lutris ===
Open Lutris and select your game. On the bottom you can see a wineglass, and on the right side of it an arrow pointing to the top. Click that arrow, and select Winetricks.
