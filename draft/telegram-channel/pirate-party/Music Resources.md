Downify -  let's you enjoy music on-the-go, even when you are offline.

Downify wants to make sure that, no one is deprived of music on that long road trip or airplane when there is no Internet Connection. You can download your Spotify playlists/albums in advance and enjoy music everywhere. And that too without annoying ads.

How it works?
It uses Spotify offical API to fetch the tracks and Youtube(youtube-dl) to download the tracks. All that happens in server side and the app just downloads the mp3 file for later.

Just add a directory, and it'll automatically download and save the .lrc files with the same name as the song so that other apps can recognise it.

Spotube  [Spotify Client]

An open source, cross-platform Spotify client that doesn't require Premium nor uses Electron!
That uses Spotify's data/discovery API and YouTube (or Piped.video) as audio source

Features:
* No ads, thanks to the use of public & free Spotify and YT Music APIs¹
* Downloadable tracks
* Cross-platform support
* Small size & less data usage
* Anonymous/guest login
* Time synced lyrics
* No telemetry, diagnostics or user data collection
* Native performance
* Open source/libre software
* Playback control is done locally, not on the server

Unsupported features
*Spotify Shows & Podcasts: Shows and Podcasts can never be supported because the audio tracks are only available on Spotify and accessing them would require Spotify Premium.
* Spotify Listen Along: Coming soon!

Fakinthefunk (https://fakinthefunk.net/en/)

Nowadays you can download tunes from anywhere.
But what is the real quality of these files?
What if you could check those tunes to see if they’re really that good, and not upscaled 128kbps to 320kbps MP3s?

You could batch-process them all without having to manually check them 1-by-1 using a spectrum analyzer?
Import your music files.
Fakin' The Funk? will analyze the right bitrate and frequency.
If it finds a wrong bitrate or lower frequency-peak, it will show you the actual bitrate.
It’s up to you whether you want to rename those files, copy or move. Or just delete them.
Fakin' The Funk? Keep it real.
