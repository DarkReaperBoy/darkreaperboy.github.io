Succinct guide on how to still access books from zlib

1. Download the Tor Browser and Telegram (app or desktop)
2. Connect to zlib by launching the browser, waiting for a connection, and then going to this site: http://zlibrary24tuxziyiyfr7zd46ytefdqbqd2axkmxm4o5374ptpc52fad.onion
3. Right click on the page
4. Click on the option that displays as "NoScript"
5. A pop-up page should appear with options for the plugin
6. On the top right, click the icon for which the hover-over text says "Enable restrictions on this tab"
7. Create an account if you don't have one (I haven't tested if you can create an account)
8. Sign in to your account
9. Find the book you want to download
10. On the page for the book, click on "Send to..." and choose Telegram
11. The page will display the name of the bot to connect to and the message to copy for the bot to connect your zlib account to telegram
12. Find the bot on telegram using the search function
13. Start a chat with the bot
14. Copy the aforementioned commands to the chat with the bot
15. Go back to zlib and click on Send to Telegram again
16. The book should be uploaded to the telegram chat

Hopefully this helps somebody. Books should be free.

PS: Obviously, do not use the same Tor session for anything sus.

sci-hub.se 2 - Like above with a more pure focus on scientific research papers.
b-ok.global 3 - E-book library.
gen.lib.rus.ec 1 - Get that book for free

1lib.eu - Get that book for free
gutenberg.org 3 - Get that book for free
standardebooks.org 4 - This is like gutenberg but the ebooks have been formatted nicely and proofed for typos

Contemporary Shadow Libraries: A Brief Overview

Shadow libraries, the repositories of books and academic papers, continue to thrive despite crackdowns and legal threats. Here's a brief overview of the current landscape and some personal commentary.

- gen.lib.rus.ec /  libgen.rs / forum.mhut.org is one of the most active and longstanding shadow libraries (see note on the Split Event). Library Genesis distributes books through IPFS, a decentralized peer-to-peer network, in addition to traditional methods. 

- libgen.fun / libgen.life - Library Genesis fork which is controlled by the original Libgen founder. It has not been updated since 2020.

- libgen.gs / libgen.li - Library Genesis fork, has slightly different collections, but is unreliable in terms of their operation.

- z-library - initially started as a Library Genesis fork. Has emerged as the library with the largest collection of books and a well-developed web interface. It has semi-commercialized its operations, which has raised concerns about the original idea behind the library and put the community under heavy legal risk that partially realised after an arrest of Z-Library operators.
Moreover, the project does not publish their own collections of books uploaded by users meaning everything may disappear after operators will earn enough money and turn off servers.

- sci-hub has retrieved a vast collection of scholarly papers in the past. It has not been updated since 2021, leaving its future uncertain.

- annas-archive.org - aggregator of Library Genesis and Z-Library books with the search engine. It is not updated regularly but seeds torrents with Z-Library collection. Tried to distribute collections through IPFS but unfortunately failed, now collection is mostly unavailable in IPFS.
 
Nexus Projects:

- Nexus Bots - use Library Genesis collections, add leaked Z-Library books and also retrieve new scholar papers. Available only in Telegram.

- Standard Template Construct / ipns://stdtc.eth is a database and search engine that works entirely over IPFS, making it impossible to be shut down or blocked. It updates not immediately but on semi-regular basis.

- Red Scriptorium Experiment - collaborative IPFS Cluster aimed to storing scholar papers and scientific texts and opened to joining for contributors. The end goal is to store entire collection of scientifically valuable texts on multiple distributed peers.

Split Event:

In 2020, a new fork called libgen.fun was created by the original creator of Library Genesis due to internal conflicts between the owners and administrators of gen.lib.rus.ec. The latter has remained under the control of its administrators and continued on its own path.

The name libgen.fun has been banned at forum.mhut.org and communication and cooperation between the two libraries seem to have ceased.

Hey-hey, we've got some big news!

✨ Z-Lib has released their data (https://t.me/zlibrary_official/31) on the IPFS network. We've already begun downloading books not present in STC. In a few months, our collection will feature all the latest books from Z-Lib

✨ Our dedicated rooms for science talks (https://t.me/+VCJ_DFS-MIc3MTA0) are open! We invite you to join, and we're also on the lookout for mods/regular posters

✨ We've started private testing of the Cybrex AI, which can answer science questions using scholarly publications as a basis. You can find examples (https://t.me/+0EG2IoqzFndhOTMy) in our freetalks chat topic. Though all sources are publicly available (https://github.com/nexus-stc/stc) for you to work with, we're seeking GPU and hardware donors to construct embeddings and LLMs for the greater good 

✨ We've kicked off the process of indexing book content. At first, EPUB files and will then expand to other formats

✨ As always, we're on the hunt for uploaders at @nexus_aaron. Hop into the chat and respond to requests by uploading papers. Our top uploaders will get priority access to Cybrex

Source extensions for the Tachiyomi/Mihon app

https://github.com/keiyoushi/tachiyomi-extensions

(Have the deleted tachiyomi extensions of mangadex, batao and plan to add other deleted extensions as well. Basically you can consider this a place to get all updates for your favourite extensions which were/are deleted if the maintainer wish to add so obviously)

Tachiyomi Has Removed All extensions from their app following DMCA issues. They have also added the feature to use external extension repos without having to re-approve unofficial extensions after each app launch. So - 

1. Use this (https://t.me/c/1574965898/572/195178). They gained quiet a traction and are actively maintaining all extensions. (Guide (https://fxtwitter.com/iiTachiyomi/status/1744508422303756565?s=19))

2. https://github.com/ThePBone/tachiyomi-extensions-revived (shared by one and only @Its_gns). The maintainer won't maintain all extensions.

3. There are many alternative apps there so you can use those as well.

PS: Don't install Random repos/apks in name of tachiyomi. Beware what you are downloading on your phone. I will keep updating with more trusted repos whenever I get it.

Peace 🕊️

Hello, as everyone know that tachiyomi is gone now but a successor is already out https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon | More (https://www.reddit.com/r/mangapiracy/s/K6Z9zsVj3W)

- My suggestion will be don't do anything now, tachiyomi will work for foreseeable future. I won't be shocked if you guys don't have to do anything for a year now.

- I will update our index manga section (https://t.me/c/1574965898/542/143819) with lots of other apps later (https://t.me/c/1574965898/542/199778)

- If you really want to use something which is completely different from Tachiyomi use Kotatsu (https://github.com/KotatsuApp/Kotatsu).
