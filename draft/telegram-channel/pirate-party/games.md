Unlock EPIC Games DLC for free using ScreamAPI 🧩

ScreamAPI is a DLC unlocker for the games that are legitimately owned in your Epic Games account. It attempts to fool games that use Epic Online Services Software Development Kit (EOSSDK) into thinking that you own the desired DLCs. However, ScreamAPI does not modify the rest of the EOSSDK, hence features like multiplayer, achievements, etc. remain fully functional.

Yanu : Yet another nps updater
https://github.com/nozwock/yanu

A script to update nsp game file to lastest version , ternux supported.

Suggest to keep atleast 3 time of combined base file and update file size more free space (tip from willfaust nsp updater gist (https://gist.github.com/willfaust/fb90dec409b8918290012031f09a78ef))
 (https://gist.github.com/willfaust/fb90dec409b8918290012031f09a78ef)
Note :
After running installation command if it say error failed after some like like chmod +x yanu and then no such directory error with big path. It is because  $PATH in termux having many /bin director paths (the error is from last few line of script)

So Run below :
echo 'proot-distro login --bind /storage/emulated/0 --termux-home ubuntu -- yanu "$@"' >> "~/../usr/bin/yanu"
chmod +x "~/../usr/bin/yanu"


Edited : tried willfaust script, seems similar outputs same as yanu

Just yanu take time to install

Yanu has better ui 

While willfuast script is simple and detect big file as base and add other file in it, not ask which to select and etc ....

Lion cubs play-fight to learn social skills. Rats play to learn emotional skills. Monkeys play to learn cognitive skills. And yet, in the last century, we humans have convinced ourselves that play is useless, and learning is supposed to be boring.

Gosh, no wonder we’re all so miserable.

Welcome to Explorable Explanations, a hub for learning through play! We’re a disorganized “movement” of artists, coders & educators who want to reunite play and learning.

mugen - a fighting game engine?

what is mugen? (watch (https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=what+is+mugen%3F) properly)
M.U.G.E.N, a hidden gem on the internet, is a versatile 2D fighting game engine that allows players to create and utilize their own custom characters and stages.

https://www.mugendb.com/search/label/games?max-results=12
(example of good mugen games are: mortal kombat new era (https://mugengames.org/mortal-kombat-new-era-mugen-pc-download/) (my friend's fav), mortal kombat multiverse hd (https://sonicjamp.itch.io/mugen-mortal-kombat-multiversus-hd) (personal fav), Jump Force Mugen (https://mugengames.org/category/jump-force-mugen/) (ppl's fav since it's all char in one))

Xeonjia

Xeonjia is an adventure game set in a frozen world where the floor is frozen, requiring careful consideration of moves as players cannot change direction until they encounter an obstacle. The game features ice slide puzzles that challenge players to use their minds to find the best path. The world has been frozen by the "King of Evil," and a brave hero is needed to defeat him and save the kingdom. As the chosen hero, players embark on a journey to explore cities, dungeons, and mystical caves, solving quests and puzzles along the way. By gaining experience points, players can level up and find money and hidden treasures to improve themselves. However, they must be cautious of dangerous enemies lurking in the frozen world. Remember, most of the floor is frozen, so players cannot stop until they reach a wall, boulder, or other obstacles. It's a frozen RPG world that requires strategic thinking and problem-solving skills.

also to make it full screen:
https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Streets_of_Rage_Remake#Borderless_fullscreen_windowed

why?
1) it's (one of) the best game(s) in my opinion that humanity has created, and this is modern remake of it
2) nostalgia
3) the soundtrack is awesome, everything about this game is modern now
4) it was taken by nega (sega) so you know how good it is that they consider it a threat
