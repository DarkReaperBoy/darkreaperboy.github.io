Generic Advice while installing Pirated software (By @iamavu )

1. If the crack or the software doesn't require internet connection while installation, please disable your Internet connection.

2. Turn off real time protection or completely disable your antivirus while installation, you can turn it back afterwards.
Guide on how to do it for windows defender - (https://www.howtogeek.com/679120/how-to-turn-off-real-time-protection-in-microsoft-defender/)

If you use any other Antivirus, google search "How to disable real time protection in <insert your Antivirus name>" will do the work.

3. After installation, please exclude the complete folder of the installed application and the crack one if it exists from your Antivirus.
Guide on how to do it for windows defender : (https://www.windowscentral.com/how-exclude-files-and-folders-windows-defender-antivirus-scans)

If you use any other Antivirus, google search "How to exclude folder in <insert your Antivirus name>" will do the work.

4. If you are installing from untrusted sources, a VirusTotal (https://www.virustotal.com/gui/) scan of the crack or keygen will do the work. (Refer Thesis On Zero Day Cracked Software, Games & Online Scanner Virus Detection (https://onehack.us/t/thesis-on-zero-day-cracked-software-games-online-scanner-virus-detection/96856) for More Knowledge about how VT works)

5. Cracks and pirated software are usually detected by Antivirus, please note that's a false positive!

6. If you are still unsure about the software, please use built-in Windows Sandbox Option(Guide (https://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-windows-sandbox-windows-10-may-2019-update)) if you have other windows version you can use sandboxie (https://www.sandboxie.com/), the download might ask for some details, please fill in fake information :D

MiXplorer keeps crashing when i try to open 'Team Drives' Folder in my GDrive Account.

How to Fix it?


> Open MiXplorer and go to GDrive section.

> Now your GDrive Folders will be showing up like 'Files, Recycle Bin, etc.

> Click the 'View' button located beside the Search button in Bottom Section.

> 'Compact' 'Columned' 'Detailed' 'Wrapped' 'Minimal' 'Grid' 'Gallery'
Total 7 Options shows up when you've clicked the 'View' Button.

> The Default view of MiXplorer is 'Compact' ,
Now change the View to 'Columned or Grid or Minimal or Gallery'. Any option you want to.

> Swipe down to refresh the MiXplorer, and then Exit App.

> And Finally Open your MiX again and try to open 'Team Drives' Folder. It will gonna open without any crashes :)

• During my Test, 'GALLERY' view option performed better than others.

Tip - After opening 'TeamDrives' folder in 'Gallery' View, you can change the View depending upon what view you like the most either Compact or Minimal,etc.

The Most Important Point to keep in your Head is that when you will Open 'Team Drives' Folder your View must be other than 'Compact or Detailed'.


Note - I've tested all this in Latest Version of MiXplorer Silver i.e., 
6.58.6-Silver B22090810

Installing GrapheneOS the Easy Way

Metal Outlaw shows us how easy it is to install GrapheneOS on a Google Pixel phone in this video 👇
https://odysee.com/@AlphaNerd:8/installing-grapheneos-the-easy-way:b

Since Mental Outlaw doesn't mention the web-page he is using, here it is:
https://grapheneos.org/install/web

It is also important to make sure you use one of the officially supported OSes as well as one of the officially supported web browsers mentioned on the web-page.

He does not mention that GrapheneOS tells you to NOT use the Flatpak or Snap versions of the browsers because they cause issues during install, and those versions may very well brick your phone.

This 👉 post (https://t.me/LinuxTechIndex/593) shows you how to get the official up-to-date version of Brave.  Make sure to turn off all script blockers before you start this process.

It is possible to brick your phone doing this improperly, so make sure you understand all the nuances before you proceed.

Method to bulk download from a channel. 

(I know mirror bots exits too to zip and all but not suitable for videos more than 30-40)

🌚 Requirements- 
A telegram channel with videos/docs in it.
Internet Download manager
A file to link bot.
A notepad.
Some brain.

--> Process -
I don't think you'll wanna download all at once. (I had to download ~500 videos)

So, forward 20-30 videos to (file to link) bot.
Open notepad parallely.
Copy download links to notepad one by one. Save it somewhere on your pc.

-->Here comes the main step -
Go to IDM and click on Tasks on the top left hand.
Click on import (via text file)
Now select that file which you saved earlier.
All videos will be there.
Select all and then download.

Done ✅

Maybe I was too noob not to know this but anyways it's worth the time.

Alternative:
or if desktop, make a fake channel and forward what you want and do a export history and you find them in there correct folder, no need for idm (also use motrix (https://motrix.app/) instead, idm is skill issue)

Scan your Android device for Virus/Malware!

🔗 Malwarebytes app (https://t.me/c/1574965898/3712/92379) 🔗

Installation & running the first scan:
1. Download and install the app from the link given above.
2. Open the app and give it the permission to access "Storage & Files".
3. Now scroll down and click on "Run full scan". Keep the app open, don't switch to other apps while the scan is in progress.
4. Once the scan is completed take necessary actions shown to remove virus/malware, if any!

FAQs & Common Issues Faced:
• Initially it will show 3 critical and 3 non-critical issues.
- You can ignore the non-critical issues.
- One of critical issues can be solved by giving permission to display over another app, one by updating the database and the last one by doing a full system scan.

• Keep the app open while a scan is in progress. You shouldn't leave the app in the background while scanning, else it will show an error showing it as an unverified app ( to fix that you will need to re-install the app)

• Initially the scan will take between 10 to 20 minutes depending on the number of apps and files you have.

• It's okay that the scan will notify itself (the downloaded Malwarebytes apk) to be a riskware, just ignore that.

**A complex guide to get domain from eu.org and setup cloudflare dns(or any other, but i used cloudflare )**

===== 1 =====
From registration on eu.org to domain request
https://youtu.be/mYvVQkbyNRg?t=116

I used cloudflare dns service you can use the one used in this video (hostry)

===== 2 =====
Add nameserver in eu.org domain settings, nameserver of dns provider you will choose eg. cloudflare then add 
aaden.ns.cloudflare.com and michelle.ns.cloudflare.com (leave other field cloudflare has only 2 nameservers)

> DNS provider will give nameserver list on there website, just find it
> Add them to eu.org name server, above example is for cloudflare nameserver

It will take time for provider to connect properly with domain
> May take a hour or two, or a day

Then you have to add DNS records which will map your website to domain. 
> Ip address and things you will need yo add in DNS records will be given by service who hosted yout website (webhostinh sites)

===== 3 : About mapping blogger blogspot to domain 👀 =====

For example blogger have 2 CNAME records  to be add  :
Blog CNAME: For name, enter the name as the subdomain, like "blog." or "www." For destination, enter “ghs.google.com.”
Security CNAME:  “Name: XXX, Destination: XXX.” This is different for each person and is specific to your blog and your Google Account.

Now after adding thise 2 CNAME, go yo blogger.com settings > custom domain > add domain you want to map with eg. Kmohzaid-blogs.eu.org (or add subdomain of your eu.org domain like blog.kmohzaid.eu.org)


Blogger DNS records add and custom domain setup guide :
https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/1233387#zippy=%2Cconnect-to-your-non-google-domain-from-blogger

Note : DNS records needed to be added in DNS provider varies on every web hosting sites/service

A guide to download HD movies/series easily using 1DM

If you don't want to torrent movies for whatever reasons or direct download link for the movie you're looking for isn't working or if the file hoster download speed is limited to 50kbps, don't worry, I got you. Just make sure you have an Android phone because all of this will be done on an Android phone.


1: Download 1DM (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=idm.internet.download.manager) from the Play Store.

2: Open 1DM and visit any movie streaming website like Flixtor (https://flixtor.id/home), Seez (https://seez.su/) or movie-web (http://movie-web.app/). Personally, I use Flixtor.

3: Then, search for the movies/series that you want and play the stream for a few seconds.

4: The number in a red bubble at the top right corner will keep increasing, 1DM is currently fetching the videos on the website, wait till it stops increasing and click on it.

5: A menu will pop up, offering various resolution options for the movie. Choose the resolution that you want and start downloading the video.

You can get many things through Bittorrents. It is one of the best ways to download Linux distros, but only if you use the official bittorrent from the distro's website.

Downloading a distro via Bittorrent might make it look like you are grabbing movies or music, so here's how you set up qBittorrent to keep yourself off of your ISP's radar.

Click each step to go to a more detailed tutorial for that step.

1. Enable Search
 (https://t.me/LinuxTechIndex/719)   (Watch ☝️ the video )

2. Require Encryption

 (https://t.me/LinuxTechIndex/721)3. Use a USA IP Blocklist

 (https://t.me/LinuxTechIndex/723)4. Limit Number of Connections

 (https://t.me/LinuxTechIndex/725)5. Limit Connection Speed

 (https://t.me/LinuxTechIndex/727)6. Use a Different Port at Each Startup

 (https://t.me/LinuxTechIndex/729)7. Use a VPN with your system 
      There are so many options
      on VPNs.  We're not going
      to attempt to tackle this.

Most tutorials recommend you use a VPN, but you can try these settings, and if your ISP leaves you alone, no need to pay for a VPN.  If you get the letter, then you can then get a VPN.

Note:  You can do the exact same things in Transmission (https://transmissionbt.com/), except search.

Most of the Telegram Users Still Doesn't Know About Encoding & it's issues.Some commonly used qualities & Keyterms in movies files of Encoders:

_WEBRip:
Recorded rip from Netflix(NF.WEBRip)/HULU(HULU.WEBRip)/Amazon(AMZN.WEBRip) or streaming services.

_WEB-DL: 
Decrypted no-loss format from-
Itunes, Google play, Amazon Prime, Netflix, AltBalaji, jio cinema, Zee5, Voot, SonyLiv, Disney+ & many more

_DVDSCR (DVD Screener):
Same premise as a screener, but transferred off a DVD. Usually letterboxed , but without the extras that a DVD retail would contain. The ticker is not usually in the black bars, and will disrupt the viewing.

_HDR:
High Dynamic Range content. Unless you have a HDR display or you are using a recommended HDR player that can do HDR->SDR conversion avoid this.

_SDR:
Standard Dynamic Range content. Suitable for all players. Most content is in SDR.

_BluRay:
This is the highest quality rip you’re going find. Most of the time it is ripped into a HD format and presented in High Def Resolution (720p – 2160p). Please note that in order to play a HD video file, you will need a powerful computer.

×264 vs ×265 which is Better ?
The major and key difference is that x265 is the successor of x264, x264 is an earlier codec and is used in a lot of videos and x265 is a newer standard. So, ×265 is better in quality if the file size is the same.

What does the "10bit" mean ?
10 bit encodes have better quality and small file size. The Only drawback is some older hardware don't support it, 10 bit fixes color ramping artifacts, which are very visible in dark scenes with objects with soft edges.

It Takes a Lot of Courage to Do this without;
• Corrupted Files
• Audio/Video Sync Issues
• Missing or Incorrect Codecs
• Quality Loss
• Playback Compatibility 
• Subtitle Problems

Consider this in your mind & keep supporting us without Any Hesitation.A single Reaction will Do A Lot of Encouragement 🙂

Fix linux mint bluetooth issue 

or you can try on other distros idk if it will work 

1.  Paste   dmesg | grep -i 'bluetooth'   in terminal  and match the hcd file from the below folder . 

2. Grab that hcd file and paste it to    /lib/firmware/brcm  folder 

3. Reboot 

Done . 

If using bluetooth and wifi at the same time bluetooth/wifi connections may interrupt . 
I found no solution for that . But someone suggested it can be fixed if you use wifi adapter  separately.

How to get stock image free without watermark and high quality 🤨

1. Go to website from which you want and download stock image

    - image will be low quality and/or definitely have watermark

2. Google search "watermark remover ai" and select any site, or use https://www.watermarkremover.io/ (first result). And then upload image, it will remove watermark

3. Google search "ai image upscaler" and visit any site or use https://imgupscaler.com/ . And  then upload image(the one of which you get after removing watermark), select upscale quality and hit start. After that download 

Enjoy, if those specific site won't work then try other


Note : stock image sites will ask for money for downloading, right click and download the stock image which will be a watermark one (in mobile long press and download), yes download has a paywall because the display one is watermarked + low quality

Using Rclone without using our own bandwidth for free

These guides allow you to use rclone without using bandwidth we have. Some platforms mentioned even have gigabits internet speed that will speed up our rclone transfers even more. Moderate usage is advised because excessive usage can be counted as an abuse and harm the platforms you're using. I am not responsible for any actions people may do using this guide.

Guide 1 is risky for account 

Guide 3 : Use github codespace 

Cons : you have to download package file and then install it because apt is broken in it.

↑🄺🄰🅃🄰🅁🄸🄽🄰↓, [3:37:11 PM]
I also considered github codespace. But it has hours limit depending on plans and it only runs if the codespace tab is still opened, so no "background" process. I left google colab for rclone transfers because of that same reason. Though technically codespace and colab are possible to use for rclone if we don't really care about background process.
