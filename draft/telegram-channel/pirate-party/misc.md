Mutagen is a new kind of remote development tool that enables your existing local tools to work with code in remote environments like cloud servers and containers. It does this by providing high-performance real-time file synchronization (https://mutagen.io/documentation/synchronization) and flexible network forwarding (https://mutagen.io/documentation/forwarding). It supports synchronization and forwarding between local systems (https://mutagen.io/documentation/transports/local), SSH-accessible locations (https://mutagen.io/documentation/transports/ssh), and Docker containers (https://mutagen.io/documentation/transports/docker).

OpenAI Cookbook. (https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook)

This repository shares example code and example prompts for accomplishing common tasks with the OpenAI API.

To try these examples yourself, you‚Äôll need an OpenAI account. Create a free account to get started.

Most code examples are written in Python, though the concepts can be applied in any language.

In the same way that a cookbook's recipes don't span all possible meals or techniques, these examples don't span all possible use cases or methods. Use them as starting points upon which to elaborate, discover, and invent.

Save videos from TikTok without a watermark

TikTok  is a service for creating and watching short videos that probably everyone knows. If we save a video from an app on our smartphone, it has a watermark of the social network and the account of the author of the video.

If you need to download videos without a watermark, you can use one of the services: qload.info (https://qload.info/ru/), ssstik.io (https://ssstik.io/ru) or ttloader.com (https://ttloader.com/ru).

Each of them works on the same script. You insert the link to the video from TikTok in the field, and then click Download.

How to clean phone speakers from water

Sooner or later everyone faces the problem of water getting into the speakers of the phone. This can lead to serious damage to the device, even when the liquid dries out. 

Fixmyspeakers.com (https://fixmyspeakers.com/) is a service that will help remove water from the speakers of your smartphone. It works in the same way as the built-in water ejection function in the Apple Watch. The service plays a certain tone that generates sound waves that cause water to be ejected. The sound from the site also pushes dust and dirt out of the speakers, so it can be used for preventive purposes.

Using the service is quite simple: you have to click on the "üí®üí¶" button. When the cleansing tone sounds, the button displays a radiation animation. The site can help even in cases where the cell phone has fallen into a toilet, pool or other container of water. Signs of water on the speakers may include muffled sound, unclean sound, or no sound at all.

Still couldn't find a solution for importing my subscriptions.csv into NewPipe so I had to improvise. Use this command to convert subscriptions.csv into newpipe_subscriptions.json:
tail +2 subscriptions.csv | awk -F',' '{ printf "{\"service_id\":0,\"url\":\"%s\",\"name\":\"%s\"},",$2,$3 }' | sed 's/,$//' | awk '{ print "{\"subscriptions\":[" $0 "]}" }' > newpipe_subscriptions.json

newpipe_subscriptions.json is similar to NewPipe export and importing that works flawlessly.
