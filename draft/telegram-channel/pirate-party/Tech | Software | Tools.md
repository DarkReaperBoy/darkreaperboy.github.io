TinEye - tineye.com

TinEye is a powerful image search and recognition engine that can help to find where an image came from and how it's being used. It uses a reverse image search where unique digital signatures are created for each submitted image and then compared to other indexed images to find matches.
Tineye finds exact matches, including images that have been altered (cropped, resized, etc). It typically doesn't find similar images but can find images with parts copied from other images.


P.S - I personally use it for finding Images with Better Res.

Create account and login
create organization and create addon for MySQL
Then it will give host,username, password, database name & port

Benefits : 
1. not limited queries (may be but not less like freedb.tech(600query per hour)(i exceed it so not enough query 😂)  )
5 connection at a time (freedb gives 1 only so connect with sqlyog or running app can't view changes at runtime so brtter 5🥺)

The Ultimate Twitter Client (Revanced Twitter + TwiFucker = VanFucker) ‎ (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E-E-P_jVkAo7oYI?format=jpg&name=small)
Author : @S_allGoodMan

I. Build Revanced Twitter through a builder of your choice. (Recommended : reisxd (https://github.com/reisxd/revanced-builder))

• Apply 'Dynamic Colors' 'Monochrome Icon' patches and leave out the 'Hide Timeline Ads' one to avoid any potential conflicts.
• Rename the apk to twitter.apk

II. Download the latest TwiFucker apk from GitHub (https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/TwiFucker/releases/)

III. Download LSPatch .JAR from GitHub (https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPatch/releases)

IV. Keep all the files in the same directory.

V. Building the VanFucker

• Make sure Java is installed on your PC/Mac/Linux/Termux
• cd into the directory with files.
• Run java -jar lspatch.jar twitter.apk -m twifucker-V.x.apk
• That's it. 

VI. Install the APK generated to enjoy VanFucker

USAGE : After logging in, go to "Settings and Privacy" > "Additional Resources" > Tap on the version number (top of the list).‎ (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E-E-P_jVkAo7oYI?format=jpg&name=small)
You'll be presented with the TwiFucker Menu where you can customise these features (https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/TwiFucker/blob/master/FEATURES.md) to your wish.

.
LibreWolf is NOT one of the browser options in KeePassXC (https://t.me/LinuxTechIndex/588), so you need to add it's connection manually.

1.  Create a .mozilla folder in your home folder if it doesn't exist.

mkdir ~/.mozilla

2. Open KeePassXC (https://t.me/LinuxTechIndex/588), and go to

  Tools
    ->Setting
      ->Browser Integration

3. Check the "Firefox" checkbox

4. Click "OK" button. This creates this file

 org.keepassxc.keepassxc_browser.json

in this folder

 ~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts

5. Create the native-messaging-hosts folder inside the .librewolf folder in your home folder.

mkdir -p ~/.librewolf/native-messaging-hosts/

6. Copy the org.keepassxc.keepassxc_browser.json file from the .mozilla folder to the .librewolf folder

cp ~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/org.keepassxc.keepassxc_browser.json ~/.librewolf/native-messaging-hosts/

7. Open LibreWolf, and follow these instructions for setting up KeePassXC in LibreWolf

> Do you wish to delete your online account? Not an issue, should it? Unfortunately, it can be very difficult to delete your account on many websites, including well-known ones like Facebook. To make account termination simple, AccountKiller compiles direct links and erasing instructions. Websites like Skype that do not allow you to easily delete your profile are blocked.

Free Unlimited Storage (GDrive Aternatives) :
As of 23 January 2023, Google completely ended their unlimited storage policy for all workspace plans. 

1.Microsoft 365 E5  (https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)(Developer subscription, yup free office 365 free, here guide by one of best contributer  (https://t.me/c/1574965898/606/50417), yup Varad Sir ( @lyrical_vr )) :
It offers unlimited access to Office 365 apps and provides OneDrive 5TB of cloud storage for free, in this subscription user can create upto 25 accounts and each account can have its own 5TB of cloud storage, that means we can extend it upto 125TB. This subscription get renewed automatically until you actively perform developer like activities, you can use this (https://github.com/kylierst/MSO_E5_Dev_AutoRenew_REVISION_2) tool to keep your subscription active for lifetime.

2.Storj.io (https://storj.io/):
Storj is block-chain based decentralised cloud storage, it offers E2E encryption and user can upload upto 150GB of data each month, so far there is no limit on total amount of data user can store.

3.LinkBox (https://www.linkbox.to/):
It offers upto 50GB of permanent storage without any bandwidth limit with API support, sufficient for average users.

4.GoFile (https://gofile.io/):
GoFile provides unlimited amount of cloud storage without any bandwidth limit with full API support, user can store infinite files or folder and can share them publicly without any limit on downloads. User can increase validity of their files by generating fake download request each week. (🤓 Trick to keep file available 😉, same as repl.it trick to keep website running which run our specific bot in background ❤️‍🔥)

5.TeraBox (https://www.terabox.com/): (MeraBox😅)
TeraBox users can get upto 1TB of cloud storage totally for free and can increase limits by doing in-app activities, user can share files publicly but other users will require a TeraBox account to access shared files but in return TeraBox will pay the commission to file owner for sharing files. (🤑, Not much😂)

6.YouTube as storage (https://github.com/DvorakDwarf/Infinite-Storage-Glitch): 🤓🎭👨‍💻

Awesome-totally-open-ChatGPT

A list of open alternatives to ChatGPT

ChatGPT is GPT-3.5 with RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) for chat system.

By alternative, I mean projects feature different language model for chat system. Projects are not counted if they are:
• alternative frontend projects because they just call the API from OpenAI.
• alternative transformer decoder • models to GPT 3.5 either because the training data of them are (mostly) not for chat system.

Mozilla removes Bypass Paywalls Clean extension from its add-ons repository

“Mozilla received a copyright takedown notice regarding this addon and forwarded it to the developer, along with instructions about how to submit a counter-notice. We haven’t received a counter-notice from this developer.”

The good news it that the author of the add-on also maintains a filter list that you can use with ad blockers, so you will get the same functionality without the extension, at least as far as the popular sites are concerned.
Filter List (https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-clean-filters/-/raw/main/bpc-paywall-filter.txt) - Add this in the UBlock Origin's filter list and apply changes.

To have a little bit more fun you can also let them throw elements from a web page. They interact with all your favorite web sites. There are many shimeji characters to choose from. Each character has its own custom behavior."

Note : 
1. idk why chase mouse make it sit down reaching mouse position(position is fixed when we click to chase mouse) and then star on it

GAppsMod

⚡️ The ultimate All-In-One Utility to tweak Google applications.
📦 GitHub Repository (https://github.com/jacopotediosi/GAppsMod)

🎁 Features:
- Supports all arm/arm64/x86/x86_64 devices and all Android versions from 5.0 (Lollipop).
- Enable/disable hidden features for all users at once when Android "multiple users" mode is in use. 
- Allows users to list and change all Phenotype DB boolean flags for all installed Google applications. 
- A convenient home screen brings together the suggested mods for the most used Google applications. 

🪶 Notes:
- Always make sure you're using the latest beta version of the Google apps you want to tweak to take advantage of the latest features. 
- Allow root access to GAppsMod, apply any mods you want, then force close and reopen Google apps a few times for them to take effect. 
- There is no need to keep GAppsMod installed after applying the desired mods, because they (should) survive Google applications updates/reinstalls over time.

What is fediverse?

A good analogy for the fediverse is email. You're probably using Gmail. Or perhaps Outlook. Or Yahoo Mail. Regardless of your choice, you can send an email to anyone in the world without knowing or caring what service they use. 

This is not the case for social media. If you're on Instagram or TikTok, and your friends or celebrities you like are on Twitter, or Facebook, you will have to sign up for each separate service to stay in touch with them. But what if you could sign up for just one site, and follow anyone in the world, just like sending them an email?
That's exactly what fediverse lets you do.

Here is some more information on the settings for how to get the best quality video downloaded (highest resolution and frame rate).

First, choose the third BestVideo option on the right (The one that looks like BestVideo[EXT=MP4]...). This will make sure it downloads the best video (highest resolution and frame rate) as well as the best audio track to accompany it.

But: If you don't have FFMPEG installed, it cannot combine those two into one video track with audio. To fix this, just click the 'Something Not Working?' tab at the top and then click the 'Audio Formats Not Working? Do you need FFMPEG?' link. This will direct you to the Stacher subreddit's Wiki where it will give you step-by-step instructions on how to setup FFMPEG for it.

It's a pretty simple fix, and basically boils down to download the FFMPEG zip from the linked GitHub repository, and place the 3 FFMPEG files it tells you in the .Stacher directory. That's really it. Afterwards, your downloaded videos will have the best quality video and audio merged into one file.

Hope this helps!

Keyoxide Mobile

A modern, secure and privacy-friendly platform to establish your decentralized online identity

Keyoxide allows you to prove “ownership” of accounts on websites, domain names, IM, etc., regardless of your username.

That last part is important: you could, for example, be ‘alice’ on Lobste.rs, but ‘@alice24’ on Twitter. And if your website is ‘thatcoder.tld’, how are people supposed to know that all that online property is yours?

Of course, one could opt for full anonymity! In which case, keep these properties as separated as possible. But if you’d like these properties to be linked and, by doing so, establish an online identity, you’ll need a clever solution.

When you visit someone’s Keyoxide profile and see a green tick next to an account on some website, it was proven beyond doubt that the same person who set up this profile also holds that account.

If everyone wonders why LSPosed can be detected by third party apps (¿gov/native test?) It is basically because the devs who actually made it also made a project for detecting it natively, Then they removed it and there were already forks of it.
It won't be fixed as i got kicked then banned for exposing their project in their group.
You guys should complain about that, It ain't fair! (Please don't be vulgar)

Distrod is a meta-distro for WSL 2 which installs Ubuntu, Arch, Debian, Gentoo, etc. with systemd in a minute for you. Distrod also has built-in auto-start feature on Windows startup and port forwarding ability. 

Features :
 - plenty of distro choice, including from linuxcontainers.org
 - systemd setup for existing distro and any new you want to add
 - 😎  boot startup of distro if you run servers on it
 - port forwarding

NOTE :  launching 2nd session of wsl give error and fix is to not use wsl-distroid, https://github.com/nullpo-head/wsl-distrod/issues/91#issuecomment-1869458564 . Seems like microsoft got systemd support and we have to enable in wsl.conf 
   - hope there are other way to use autostart, maybe autostart will still work

See those guides :

  2. https://github.com/nullpo-head/wsl-distrod#see-also-1
  3. https://github.com/nullpo-head/wsl-distrod#see-also-2

PS : systemd have big conspiracy, because it has bloatware features 🗿but i still use it demn where can i get shutdown command in wsl without systemd

PS : I use ArchWsl (https://t.me/c/1574965898/781/191272), btw. (enabled systemd and boot on startup using distroid)

Podman & it's Desktop 
https://podman.io
https://podman-desktop.io

🚀 Considering a switch from Docker to Podman? 🐳 Podman claims to be faster, more secure, and open. With its recent desktop application release, it's now a mature alternative. Podman supports all common operating systems. It's easy to install and offers seamless transition tools. Podman's CLI is similar to Docker's, making it easy to switch. It lacks native support for Docker Compose files but offers a transition layer. Podman's security features, like rootless and daemonless container handling, make it appealing. It supports grouping containers in "pods," simplifying networking. Podman Desktop also supports multiple container engines and orchestrators. While Docker still leads in popularity and content availability, Podman excels in security and advanced features. Have you considered making the switch? Let us know! #PodmanVsDocker #Containerization #Container #Podman #Docker

Use telegram storage as your drive.
Has android app as well as pc / web client.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kratosle.unlim

Some points below. 

1. Ability to sync device files with the telegram ( Data gets sent to your saved messages with folder structure tags)

2. Ability to free up device storage for files that have been uploaded to telegram

3. Tags media with description and categorises media into collections automatically if enabled (behaves like Google photos)

4. Caution : Carefully choose the folders to sync. I imagine a loop issue if you choose telegram media directory and have auto download telegram media enabled on telegram. ( will need to confirm this with Dev, will update once I get a response) 

5. Closed source code. Be wary of data that you sync.

zx : A tool for writing better scripts
https://github.com/google/zx
https://www.npmjs.com/package/zx
https://google.github.io/zx/ | https://google.github.io/zx/getting-started

Run Bash directly in javascript and code a shell script written in javascriot with easy call to bash commands.

Bash is great, but when it comes to writing more complex scripts, many people prefer a more convenient programming language. JavaScript is a perfect choice, but the Node.js standard library requires additional hassle before using. The `zx` package provides useful wrappers around `child_process`, escapes arguments and gives sensible defaults.

PS : cool project, i liked it but not gonna use in day to day bases. Better keep vanilla bash scripts 😊

btw it is cool and can use in many situations eg. formatting data using javascript is easier then bash
