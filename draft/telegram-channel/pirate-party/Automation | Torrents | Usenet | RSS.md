Kill The NewsLetter
http://kill-the-newsletter.com

Create a RSS feed from email newsletter using this, just give name of inbox and it will give you email and url, use email to subscribe to newsletter and and using url you can get all newsletter as RSS

very useful if newsletter doesnt has RSS ( many websites/people just provide newsletter not RSS for news)

How to bypass email reply verify?
Some newsletter verify that it was you who subscribe to newsletter by asking you to reply with text "OK" or "CONFIRM" or just reply to current email 

How to do it here? there is not known way lol
But a trick i got in mind and it is legit : Just use any new gmail or any other email services account to subscribe to newsletter and set up filters to forward mail you will receive to RSS email you get from kill the newsletter

my (shitty) trick to get rssfeed for any podcast:
1) go to

2) search for your fav podcast name, then play an episode
3) copy the link i mentioned in pic (painful because of popup, but try your best)
4) success, now you copied, add to your rss app


bonus:
for developer podcast at least, go to
https://dev.to/pod
then check what interests you, then search the name in google pndcast

A simple javascript programm to grab the image urls from any discord server or channel and save the urls in a text file. Works on discord web only 😁

let imageUrls = [];
document.querySelectorAll('a[data-role="img"]').forEach((images) => {
    const img = images.getAttribute("href");
imageUrls.push(img);
});
const textToSave = imageUrls.join('\n');
const blob = new Blob([textToSave], { type: 'text/plain' });
const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
const link = document.createElement('a');
link.download = 'imageUrls.txt';
link.href = url;
link.click();
URL.revokeObjectURL(url);

And if you've wget installed on your pc then open terminal and run
wget -i imageUrls.txt
to download all images from the links inside the .txt file.

https://github.com/spacecowboy/Feeder/releases/

Feeder is a fully free/libre feed reader. It supports all common feed formats, including JSONFeed. It doesn't track you. It doesn't require any setup. It doesn't even need you to create an account! Just setup your feeds, or import them from your old reader via OPML, then get on with syncing and reading.


Can say : it is a good rss feed and FOSS alternative for inoreader.com

Similar to inoreader and many good features will come I hope

Instruction how to build Google emojis 🤠 on Debian/Ubuntu (even on WSL) based Linux distros:

1: Download this repo github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji (http://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji)
2. Open terminal inside noto-emoji-main folder
3. make sure you have all installed:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install python3
sudo apt-get install pkg-config
sudo apt-get install pngquant
sudo apt-get install zopfli
sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
sudo apt-get install python3.10-venv
sudo apt-get install gcc
sudo apt-get install make


4. paste these commands too:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Now you are ready to do some modifications to these emojis.
You can add new emojis to png/126 folder (other resolutions does not do anything at all) and in SVG folder you can only replace existing ones. 

6. Now you are ready to build the PNG ones.
time make -j BYPASS_SEQUENCE_CHECK='True'

building emojis takes like 2 hours or 5 minutes
depends on your CPU.

7. After finishing building emojis remove fonts from "fonts" folder then type this command
mv *.ttf fonts/

8. now you can build COLRv1 (SVG android 13+) font
(cd colrv1 && rm -rf build/ && time nanoemoji *.toml)
cp colrv1/build/NotoColorEmoji.ttf fonts/Noto-COLRv1.ttf
cp colrv1/build/NotoColorEmoji-noflags.ttf fonts/Noto-COLRv1-noflags.ttf

This also takes time even 2h or 5 minutes

9. Once it finishes run command
shell
python colrv1_postproc.py


This fixes ZWJ emojis. (Instead of displaying ❤🔥it shows correct one ❤️‍🔥)

10. Now you can use fonts that are inside fonts folder.
You can now install them on Linux or install Windows Compatible on Windows or even pack them to flashable magisk zip like I do.


If you have any problems it should show you which emoji makes problem then remove it or fix it from from both png/126 and build/compressed_pngs

Good luck! 🙌
