How to clear file metadata that can track you

Metadata (https://www.adarsus.com/en/remove-metadata-online-document-image-video/) is contained in almost every file, from photos to Word documents. Because they are automatically generated, metadata can reveal sensitive information. Such as the location, GPS coordinates, and name of the device. Fortunately, they are very easy to delete.

metaClean (https://www.adarsus.com/en/remove-metadata-online-document-image-video/)  is a site where you can erase metadata from any file. The service was developed by a Spanish company that creates and distributes software for advanced metadata management for office and multimedia files.

Open the service MetaClean (https://www.adarsus.com/en/remove-metadata-online-document-image-video/). Select the file you need by clicking on «Choose file or drug it here»,, or just drag it into the service window. When the file is downloaded, you can see what metadata it contains. Click "Get my file clean" to get rid of all metadata.

AURORA Agent
https://www.nextron-systems.com/aurora/ (explore site for better information)

The AURORA Agent is a lightweight and customisable EDR agent based on Sigma (https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma). It uses Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) to recreate events that are very similar to the events generated by Microsoft’s Sysmon (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) and applies Sigma rules and IOCs to them. AURORA complements the open Sigma standard with “response actions” that allow users to react to a Sigma match.

It is everything that other EDRs aren’t.

    - it is completely transparent and fully customisable due to the open Sigma rule set and configuration files
    - it saves 99% of the network bandwidth and storage
    - it works completely on-premises, no data leaves your network
    - it can be configured to use only a limited amount of resources


AURORA Lite : A free version that anyone can use. Limited features but not bad 🙂


Demo : https://youtu.be/R3fFzYXKn3c (1 month old haha, watched just now and sending now)

uBlock Origin filters to remove distraction

uBlock Origin filters to remove unnecessary distractions from some websites.

Make advertisers cry

If you are like me and don't support the fact that some companies track you like monsters (knowing more than your mom does), then there is a really cool thing that can make their life miserable 😀

Mozilla recently launched a service that will open 100 tabs for you, moving your advertising profile to the one you select. Currently, you can become either a rich guy, influencer or a Armageddon paranoic. 

Do note that your real advertising profile will be replaced and you might be getting info on where to find the nearest shelter and how to get your food survive a few years underground.

No mobile support through (makes sense).

https://trackthis.link/

Also, if you haven't thought of this yet, let me just tell you that Firefox and Brave are equally good browsers that are not making money mainly on advertisement and collecting user's data. The last one even pays you for viewing ads.
