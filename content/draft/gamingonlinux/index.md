You can also ask for help in the Weekly Tech Support Thread that's pinned to the top of [https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming /r/linux_gaming]. The relevant distro subreddit may also be useful - the popular ones can be found on the /r/linux sidebar. If the problem is a game-specific one, then searching out support from the game's website, subreddit, or Steam community hub may be of help. Otherwise, you may find the following links of use:
