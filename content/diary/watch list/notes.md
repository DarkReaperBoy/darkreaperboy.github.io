Mass surveillance is a backdoor into freedom of speech. Knowledge is power. Power corrupts. And absolute power corrupts absolutely.

History is always written by the winners. When two cultures clash, the loser is obliterated, and the winner writes the history books-books which glorify their own cause and disparage the conquered foe. As Napoleon once said, 'What is history, but a fable agreed upon?
-Dan Brown

the winners are the only ones that write history.
-Unknown ex-nazi

History is the propaganda of the victors.

you get to pretend that locking people out of the hardware is for their own good as long as you continue to update their software for free.

This is what fake news is made of:
Something that 0.0001% of the population is doing (protesting)

The ONLY story that makes it on the various news sites (it's eye catching)

Everyone gets a skewed reality that no one likes this new King and has been against the monarchy this entire time.

We had another study a few days ago about how one way to convince people to change their mind is to convince them that everyone else already has. The media is controlling people more than anyone realizes.

The problem with the LGBTQ community is that they think that you need to embrace and support their views 100% in order to not be homophobic.

I guess by the Western definition of homophobia , all of us Muslims are homophobes. And it's something we should be proud of. 

Well, Muslims should be anti-homo not homophobic. What’s there to fear about lol?

Homophobia is a buzzword. People who are against the LGBT community aren't afraid of homosexuality. Same way people against alcohol consumption don't run away when they see a bottle of whiskey. We simply recognise the embracing of homosexually as a sin.

 But you shouldn’t support or befriend them either
